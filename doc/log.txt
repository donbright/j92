day one.

I am deciding to make a library that only produces Convex Polyhedra of
regular faces, aka the Johnson Solids.

by limting to just these i think i will be able to accomplish the goal
because the goal exists and is definite. limitations can sometimes bring
about important help to a project and a person

------------


i cannot decide exactly how to structure things. my main point right now
is that in storing polyhedron points, vertices, i dont know if i want
to store the vertices and then the faces as indexes to the vertices,

or just store faces as a sequence of vertices. this lists some vertices
multiple times, should i care? 

the upside is its comptaible with a bunch of different file formats

the downside is that it is kind of more clean / elegant to do all vertcies
then thre is just basically a single type of data, lists of vertices.

guess i will stick with tradition for now.

generics - learning about generics in rust, im using Chat GPT as a kind
of professor to help me understand. and this is why i need num_traits
so i can multiply a generic type by a number 1 or -1

trait bounds

by restricting which traits your code is enabled for you can 
like, make generic, but not totally generic, you can do stuff
with it. like add.
