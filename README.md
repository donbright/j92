# J92

This computer code, in the Rust language, provides data on the 
ninety-two Johnson Solids - Convex Polyhedra that have Regular Polygons 
as Faces. It can output vertices in various precisions and formats.

# usage

Todo. 

# Why j92? 

The philosophy of this package is that by limiting ourselves, we can 
accomplish something interesting. This package will only ever implement 
the Johnson Solids, in other words, Polyhedron with Regular Polygon faces
