# J92

This computer code, in the Rust language, provides data on the 
ninety-two Johnson Solids - Convex Polyhedra that have Regular Polygons 
as Faces. It can output vertices in various precisions and formats.

# Why j92? 

The philosophy of this package is that by limiting ourselves, we can 
accomplish something interesting. This package will only ever implement 
the 92 Johnson Solids, no more, and no less, no other types of solids 
will ever be added, and none will be taken away. It is only designed for 
the 92 Johnson Solids and nothing else will ever be added to it. There
are dozens if not hundreds of other codes that can accomplish those things.
Here we focus on a specific goal, and by that focus, hope to be a very
high quality implementation of that goal.
